Repo for leaflet challenge

I chose to visualize "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" with the data set comming from: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

As per instructions, Level 1 challenge is in the Leaflet-Step-1 folder and the bonus is in Leaflet-Step-2.
